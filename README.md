SER capitalizes on the fact that voice often reflects underlying emotion through tone and pitch. This is also the phenomenon that animals like dogs and horses employ to be able to understand human emotion. SER is tough because emotions are subjective and annotating audio is challenging.
Speech emotion recognition is one of the active researches in machine learning. There are already applications that use speech emotion recognition as its feature. 
Our purpose is to examine the difference in performance of model using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and HuBert model with Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) on Ravedess Dataset.
Additional we have also created our own dataset and tested it out on the model which performed best.
